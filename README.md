<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive testing framework that leverages Cucumber, TestNG, JDBC, and Java to facilitate robust database testing. It is designed to enable the execution of SQL queries and verification of database states through automated tests. The framework allows for the integration of database testing with behavior-driven development practices and offers a structured approach to ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Key Technologies

- Cucumber: A framework that supports behavior-driven development (BDD), allowing you to write human-readable tests that describe the system's behavior.
  
- TestNG: A testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit, designed for running tests in Java. It provides powerful features like parallel execution, annotations, and flexible test configurations.
  
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): An API for connecting and executing queries with databases, allowing Java applications to interact with various database systems.
  
- Java: The primary programming language used for developing the framework, ensuring a strong foundation for implementing and running tests.
  
- SQL: The standard language for managing and querying databases, used here for defining the queries executed by the framework.
